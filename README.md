Enrollment System in De La Salle University is one example of an online enrollment system that makes it possible for users to process for their different courses. The registration process first allows users to input their DLSU account in Animo.sys portal then showing main features of the system such as Schedule of Enrollment, Claiming of Enrollment Assessment Form (EAF), Payment of tuition fee, and etc. These features allow users to efficiently enroll faster compared to Traditional Enrollment. After the user is done selecting different courses, the users are required to click confirmation of their enrollment which will display the list of summary of their chosen courses and display the option of tuition fee assessment.
